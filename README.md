# AI Guides
These are AI generated guides (currently Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for libraries and concepts that I use/am interested in semi-regularly.

Because it's AI, these need to (and will) be consistently tested against to ensure that they're valid.

## Table of Contents

    - Detailed Raylib guide with examples in Zig
    - Comprehensive Raygui guide with examples in Zig
    - Basic `zig test` module guide
